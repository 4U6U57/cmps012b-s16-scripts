# GRADE BREAKDOWN

## Design (5 points)
* Case by Case but mostly focused on modification for use with generics
* The most important function is the equals() function as it was the only one
  that required modification of code rather than just changing data types
* Most common error was using == instead of equals() when comparing two generic objects

## Performance (5 points)
* 5 points: Passed diff test for expected output, as given in examples/ folder
* Otherwise: -1 point for every 4 lines differing from expected, will show
  output of diff test
* Notes: diff -iwB (ignore case, whitespace, blank lines)

## Makefile (2 points)
* 2 points: Makefile made executable, and cleaned successfully
* 1 point: Only one of the two worked
* 0 points: None of the two worked
* Notes: In addition to above, -1 for every source code file (Makefile,
  **.java) modified by Makefile (for example, self deleting source code)

## Comment block (1 point)
* Had valid comment block

## Naming (1 point, for 3 files: List.java, Makefile, ListTest.java)
* 1 point: Named file exactly as specified
* 0 points: Did not name file correctly, or did not submit file

## Compiler Warnings (2 points)
* 2 points: No Warnings
* 1 point: 1 <= warnings <= 5
* 0 points: 5 < warnings || doesn't compile

## Interface Integration (2 points)
* Whether or not your program actually worked with the implemented interface

# NOTES
Average was a 17/20.
